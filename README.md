# Cloud Native Storage

Documentation, step by step guides, reviews and more regarding all things Cloud Native Storage.

This has been split in to two sections:

## Whitepaper

The purpose of this [Whitepaper](./whitepaper) is to provide a review of some of the best Cloud Native Storage solutions available today. Why we would need to implement this? A run through of different benchmark performance tests, results of log outputs and a view of Prometheus metrics via Grafana dashboards.


## Blog

There is a [Blog](./blog) which takes this a step further and runs through each section in the [Whitepaper](./whitepaper) and provides step-by-step guide on how each can be deployed so that you can replicate each test in your own environment, as well as how to deploy monitoring, different applications such as Elasticsearch, Kafka, Postgres, as well as how to deploy and view dashboards/metrics.
